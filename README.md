# gun - Go rUN

**gun** is a CLI utility to unify build, run, debug, and test workflows across multiple programming
languages. It uses a simple config system to define how a project should compile and run, making it
easier to manage different types of codebases with one consistent command.

This means whether you’re working on a system C project, an embedded C project, a Python script, or
something else, you don’t need to remember language-specific build/run steps — just define it once
and run it the same way every time.
